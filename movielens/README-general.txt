---------------------------------

This directory contains data from the "MovieLens"
movie recommendation system:

www.movielens.org

Specifically, the data in the package is the 100k-ratings
data set (100,000 ratings for 1682 movies by 943 users),
downloaded from:

http://www.grouplens.org/node/73

The data files are in the "data" subdirectory. Importantly,
The package also contains code for easily reading the data 
into Matlab/Octave/R and some demo code showing examples 
of looking at the data.

The files are provided here to help the students of the
Introduction to Machine Learning course quickly get started 
analyzing the data without having to figure out the details
of the data format and how to load it. 

The files are provided exclusively for the above purpose.
Do not distribute.

Please see the demo code for examples of how to use the 
data.
